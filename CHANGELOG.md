# Changelog
In addition to updates which reflect our implementation of innovative technologies and compliance with evolving regulations, Linode regularly utilizes community feedback for optimizing the legal, stylistic and organizational presentation of our legal agreements. Moving forward, Linode will also be utilizing changelogs to enhance transparency and to assist customer understanding of Linode’s commitment to privacy. We encourage all customers to review the entirety of Linode’s current legal agreements, as well as the below summaries highlighting key version-to-version changes. 

* **v1.1** [29 Aug 2018]  
  * **[Privacy Policy]** Privacy Shield Notice and Disclosures: To make it easier for you to find information about Linode’s participation in the U.S. Privacy Shield, we have incorporated a Privacy Shield notice at the beginning of our Privacy Policy. This section outlines Linode’s protection of your privacy during cross border transfers of data, how and why Linode shares your information with our subprocessors, and more clarity as to your dispute resolution options. 
  * **[Privacy Policy]** Legal Disclosure: The language “subject to service of lawful process” was inserted to Section 5 to make it abundantly clear that Linode only complies with legal disclosure demands when compelled by law. User privacy has been a part of Linode’s DNA since we first opened our doors, and we wanted to make sure our words were as unambiguous as our actions. 
  * **[Privacy Policy]** Payment Processor Updates: At the request of our payment processor, we globally changed references from Vantiv eCommerce, LLC to Worldpay, Inc. Nothing has substantively changed to the payment process for Linode goods and services. 
  * **[Privacy Policy]** Updated formatting and organization.
